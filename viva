What are the key components of an Android application?
The key components of an Android app include:
▪ Activities: Represents a screen with a user interface.
▪ Services: Background tasks that run without a UI.
▪ Broadcast Receivers: Respond to system-wide broadcast announcements 
(e.g., network changes).
▪ Content Providers: Allow data sharing between applications.
▪ Intents: Used to communicate between components (e.g., open a new 
screen).
What is an Activity in Android? Can you explain its lifecycle?
o An Activity is a single screen in an Android app that provides a user interface. Each 
Activity interacts with the user through UI elements (buttons, text fields, etc.).
o Activity Lifecycle: The lifecycle methods include:
▪ onCreate(): Called when the activity is first created.
▪ onStart(): Called when the activity becomes visible.
▪ onResume(): Called when the activity starts interacting with the user.
▪ onPause(): Called when the activity is partially obscured but still visible.
▪ onStop(): Called when the activity is no longer visible.
▪ onDestroy(): Called when the activity is being destroyed.
▪ onRestart(): Called when the activity is being restarted after being stopped
What is an Intent in Android? What are the different types of Intents?
o An Intent is a messaging object used to request an action from another component 
(e.g., Activity, Service).
o Types of Intents:
▪ Explicit Intent: Specifies the component to be called by its class name (e.g., 
opening a specific activity).
▪ Implicit Intent: Does not specify the component directly but allows Android 
to determine which component (app) can handle the action (e.g., opening a 
web page in a browser).
What is a Fragment, and how is it different from an Activity?
o A Fragment is a modular section of an Activity. It represents a part of the UI and can 
be reused within different Activities.
o Differences:
An Activity is a complete UI component, while a Fragment represents a 
portion of the UI that is typically part of an Activity.
▪ A Fragment can be added, removed, or replaced dynamically at runtime, 
while Activities are generally static.
▪ Fragments can manage their own lifecycle, but they depend on the Activity 
for context.
What are Gradle?
o Gradle is the build automation tool used by Android Studio. It compiles, packages, 
and manages dependencies for Android projects.
What is the AndroidManifest.xml file, and what is its purpose?
o The AndroidManifest.xml file is a required component of every Android app. It 
provides essential information about the app to the Android system, including:
▪ Declaring Activities, Services, and Broadcast Receivers.
▪ Permissions required by the app (e.g., Internet access, location).
▪ Defining app’s minimum SDK version and features.
What is a Layout in Android?
A Layout in Android is a container that holds UI components (views) such as buttons, text 
fields, and images.
What are the different types of Layouts available in Android?
Android provides several types of layouts that allow you to organize views in different ways:
o LinearLayout: Arranges the child views either vertically or horizontally.
o RelativeLayout: Arranges child views relative to each other or to the parent layout.
o ConstraintLayout: A flexible and efficient layout for creating complex UIs with fewer 
nested views, using constraints between the views.
o FrameLayout: A simple layout that stacks its children on top of each other, with the 
first child being at the bottom.
o GridLayout: Places child views in a grid-like structure, with rows and columns.
o TableLayout: Arranges child views in rows and columns like a table.
How does Toast work in Android?
• A Toast is a simple popup message that displays at the bottom of the screen (by default), and 
you can customize the position, duration, and content.
• It is commonly used for showing quick messages, such as "Data saved", "Network error", or 
"Invalid input".
What are SharedPreferences in Android
SharedPreferences is a key-value storage mechanism provided by Android to store 
small amounts of primitive data (like user preferences, settings, or simple app state 
data) in a persistent way. 
ArrayAdapter in Android
An ArrayAdapter in Android is a type of Adapter that binds a data source (usually 
an array or a list) to a ListView, Spinner, or other types of views that need to display 
a list of items.
Features of SQLite Database in Android
SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, self-contained relational database engine that is 
widely used in Android applications for local data storage. It is embedded directly 
into the application and provides an efficient way to store and retrieve structured data.
